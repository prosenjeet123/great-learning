# GreatLearning.com Interview challenge

The complete html has been created with vanilla css ,pure javascript (No plugins) and saas followed with BEM structure. All the bonus points has been marked done in this project.
The slider which is made on purely javascript has some mobile issues on some IOS phones which will be fixed in the future release because i haven't got the time to debug the issue and make it work.
However it's working completely fine in web.

This project has been made with the best of my knowledge. I have tried to improve the sharpness and clarity of the text,icons and images by using only html entity codes and google fonts to fulfill the logo and icons.
The script part has been written in a organized way along with the comments for better readability.
This project has been made within 2 days of time and day night hardwork.
